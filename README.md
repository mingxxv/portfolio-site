## Personal Portfolio

Development files for my personal website.

Followed the example given in this [Javascript Mastery tutorial](https://youtu.be/OPaLnMw2i_0), and modified to suit my needs.

I highly recommend following this tutorial, especially if you're a beginner - or if you need a refresher course like I did!

## Development

### Tech Stack
* React
* Next.JS 
* Styled Components
* React Icons

### Getting Started

This version of Next.js seems to have issues on the latest version of Node - you can solve this by using the LTS version of Node. I highly recommend using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for this, and running `nvm install 'lts/*'` once you're done with installing it.

Install the packages
``` npm i```

Run the development server
```npm run dev```

If all goes well (it should!) you should be able to access the site on `localhost:3000`.
